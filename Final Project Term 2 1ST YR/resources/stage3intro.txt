*At the finals*
The atmosphere in the auditorium buzzed with anticipation. 
Rows of students, faculty, and alumni filled the seats, their murmurs blending into an excited hum. 
Large screens on either side of the stage displayed the competition brackets, flashing the names of the 
remaining contenders. 
Spotlights illuminated the long table at the center, where mechanical keyboards were neatly arranged, their 
polished surfaces reflecting the bright overhead lights.

The host, dressed sharply, stepped forward with a microphone in hand.

Host: Today is the final day for this competition! This is the showdown between different college 
branches as they fight to become
      this year's typing champion!
You: There's so many people watching today..
CSIS Contestant: It's bad news for you freshman, all of us have years of experience in typing. 
You are no match against us.
You: I don't know, maybe I do, maybe I don't.
CSIS Contestant: You have some guts to say that from a top ranker. Good luck to you freshman.
You: Okay...
