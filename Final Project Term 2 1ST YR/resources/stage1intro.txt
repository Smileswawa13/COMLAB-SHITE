The classroom buzzed with energy as students chatted amongst themselves,
some flipping through their notebooks while others scrolled through their phones.
Sunlight streamed through the windows, casting a warm glow on the wooden desks arranged in neat rows.
The whiteboard at the front of the room was covered in leftover notes from the last lesson,
and the faint scent of chalk lingered in the air.

At the teacherâ€™s desk, a stack of papers rustled as the instructor cleared their throat,
signaling for attention. Conversations gradually died down as students turned their heads toward the front.
Some looked curious, while others seemed indifferent,
slouching in their chairs. A few exchanged glances, wondering what the announcement might be.

Then, the teacher spoke.

Teacher: Hello Everyone, there is an announcement from the School that there will be a contest against different
 schools. Students who get 3.0 in all subjects are eligible to become the one who will compete for the school.

Classmate 1: Wow, sounds like someone is good for this.
Classmate 2: It's her! I heard she writes books and magazines!
You: (Maybe I should try it out since I have done a lot of online argume- I mean typing games before)
Rival: I guess I can do this, I just need to be the one to become the highest.
You: (One problem, our school famous book and magazine author.) Hmmm I wonder if I should do it...
Classmate 2: Is this guy really want to beat her?
Classmate 1: *Whispers to Classmate 1* Hey, lets sabotage his projects to make him fail a subject.
