The glow of your computer screen softly illuminates your room as you sit at your desk, 
the typing contest trophy resting beside your keyboard. 
The cheers and applause from the competition still echo in your mind, 
but now, everything is quiet. Just you, your thoughts, and the steady hum of your computer.

You: (Leaning back in your chair, staring at the ceiling) "I actually won..."
You glance at the screen, muscle memory making your fingers twitch over the keyboard. 
For years, typing was just a hobby—arguing online, playing typing games, writing for fun. 
And yet, all of it led to this moment.
You: (Laughs softly to yourself) "Guess all those late nights weren’t a waste after all."

A message notification pops up on your screen. It’s from the CSIS contestant.
CSIS Contestant: "GG. You got me this time, but I’m coming back stronger next year. Enjoy the win, champ."
You smile, fingers effortlessly typing out a response.
You: "Looking forward to it. GG."

Another message comes in, this time from The Rival.
The Rival: "You actually did it. I don’t regret stepping down, but man, that was fun to watch. 
Maybe I should start practicing again."
You: "You should. I wouldn’t mind a rematch someday."
You push away from the desk and glance at the trophy again. Maybe this was just the beginning.
There were bigger competitions out there, more challengers to face. 
But for now, you had proven to yourself that you were more than just a random participant.

You: (Stretching and yawning) "Tomorrow… I guess I'll see what’s next."

With a satisfied sigh, you switch off your monitor. The journey may have started in your room, 
but it certainly wouldn’t end here.
