The auditorium fell into an anxious silence as the host took center stage, 
holding an envelope containing the final results. 
Contestants stood behind their respective college banners, 
eyes locked onto the host, waiting for their fate to be revealed.

The audience, a mix of students, faculty, and alumni, 
leaned forward in their seats, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife. 
The large LED screen above the stage flickered, ready to display the final rankings.

The host cleared his throat and spoke into the mic.
