The competition hall is silent, the air thick with anticipation as 
everyone waits for the final results. The digital scoreboard flickers,
the numbers processing as the system determines the winner.
The tension is palpableâ€”some contestants are leaning forward,
gripping the edges of their desks, while others sit back, nervously tapping their fingers.

At the front of the room, the host stands on stage, microphone in hand,
eyes scanning the gathered competitors. They take a deep breath, letting the suspense
build before finally speaking.

Host: And the winner is....
      *Drum Roll*
Host: <You>!!
      *Applause*
Host: A new challenger won in this branch and will now compete for the finals against other
college branches!

Another Contestant: How?! I was second place again!! Just who are you!?
You: I am just a person who wanted to participate in a contest.
Another Contestant: Beginners luck isn't it? Next time, just you wait!
