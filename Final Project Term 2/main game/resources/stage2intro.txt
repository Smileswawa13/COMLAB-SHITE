*At the day of the competition*

The competition hall is buzzing with energy, filled with the sound of excited 
chatter and rapid keystrokes from contestants warming up. The room is spacious 
and brightly lit, with rows of computers neatly arranged, each equipped with 
high-end mechanical keyboards and large monitors displaying the competition interface.

At the front of the hall, a massive digital scoreboard hangs, currently blank, 
soon to be updated with the names and scores of the fastest typists. 
Banners representing different schools line the walls, each displaying their 
institution’s emblem with pride.

The air is thick with anticipation and tension—some contestants are calmly stretching their fingers, 
while others glance around nervously, eyeing their competition. 
You stand among them, taking in the sight of dozens of skilled typists, 
many of whom have competed in national-level events.

Then, the host steps onto the stage, holding a microphone. Their voice booms through the speakers, 
silencing the crowd.

Host: Another day another competition for all of the contestants! But this day will be the battle between
all CEA schools!
You: These people are well known writers! I wonder if I have a chance.
Another Contestant: Oh a new guy! Where is that famous girl in your school? You beat her?
You: Uhm. Yeah I guess?
Another Contestant: What a joke! You? Beating the best in this branch? That just gives me more chance to win!
You: Uhuh... Okay.
